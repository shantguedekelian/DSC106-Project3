        A rationale for your design decisions. 
        How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? 
        What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
      </strong>
        <li>Visual Encodings: We chose to represent each fire with a red circle because
      Red is often associated with fire and danger, making it an intuitive choice 
      for representing fire incidents. The size of the circles is adjusted based 
      on the intensity of the fire detection, allowing users to quickly assess 
      the seriousness of each fire.
      </li>
      <li>Interaction Techniques: We used zooming to allow users to explore
      different regions of the map in detail. This is particularly useful for
      examining areas with a high density of fire incidents. The time slider
      enables users to filter fire incidents based on the hour of the day,
      providing insights into temporal patterns of fire occurrences. The play
      button animates the time slider, allowing users to observe how fire incidents
      change over time without manual input. Lastly we added a tooltip which
      provides additional information about each fire when hovered over, enhancing
      the user experience by providing context-specific details.
      </li>
      <li>Alternatives Considered: We considered using color gradients to represent
      fire intensity, but decided against it to maintain clarity and avoid
      potential confusion with other map elements. We also thought about using
      heatmaps to represent fire density, but opted for individual circles to
      provide more granular information about each fire incident.

          An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. 
        Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
        Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? 
        What aspects took the most time?
        </strong>

        <li>Who did what: We all contributed to visualization ideas and implementing the features
          in d3. Shant worked on getting the data set up and the write-up. Jaden worked on polishing 
          the time slider and play button. Lastly Marcelo worked on adding the state borders and 
          interaction as well as the overall polish of the visualization
        </li>
        <li>Time Spent: We spent around 20 hours in total developing the application.
          The most time-consuming aspects were data preprocessing and ensuring smooth
          interactions with the time slider and play button. Also coming up with an idea
          that was feasible within the time constraints took some time.
